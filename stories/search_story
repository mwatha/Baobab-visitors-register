Story: Patient search

  As a logged in user
  I want to register a patient or find an existing patient
  So that I can enter their visit information and cure them

  Scenario: Patient does not already exist
    Given a logged in user
    When I search for a patient with the first name 'Dennis' and last name 'Rodman' and gender 'Male'
    Then it should have an option for 'Create a new person with the name Dennis Rodman'
    And should not have an option for 'Evan Waters, Birthdate: 1982-06-09'

  Scenario: Similar patient exists
    Given a logged in user
    And an existing patient with the named 'Evan Waters' and birthdate '1982-06-09'
    When I search for a patient with the same demographics
    Then it should have an option for 'Create a new person with the name Evan Waters'
    And should have an option for 'Evan Waters, Birthdate: 1982-06-09'
 
  Scenario: Patient already exists with health passport
    Given a logged in user
    And an existing patient with the identifier '311'
    When I scan the barcode
    Then it should show the patient
  
  Scenario: Patient already exists with no health passport
    Given a logged in user
    And no existing patient with the identifier '311'
    When I scan the barcode
    Then it should say the patient was not found
    And show an option 'Create a new person'
    And remember the identifier
